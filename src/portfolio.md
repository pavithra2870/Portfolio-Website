## **Bio**
I am an engineer and researcher focused on **Explainable AI (XAI)**, **Multi-Agent Systems**, and **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows**. My work bridges the gap between black-box AI models and human trust, building systems that are not just intelligent but transparent, fair, and accountable—whether in education, finance, law, or network optimization.

## **Ongoing Research & Innovation**

### **1. AI-Assisted Human-in-the-Loop Relative Grading System**
* **Concept:** A comparative marking system that learns a teacher's grading patterns using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). It moves beyond absolute scoring to "relative grading" by comparing answer sheets against a cohort.
* **Key Innovation:** Integrates **XAI (Explainable AI)** to justify grades to students and **RL** to adapt to the specific "strictness" or "leniency" of a human evaluator.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, RLHF, LLMs, XAI (SHAP/LIME), Vector Databases.

### **2. Deep Learning for Stock Fibonacci Algorithm Validation**
* **Concept:** A multimodal semantic analysis tool that validates Fibonacci retracement levels for stock prediction. It visualizes market trends and predicts buy/sell zones with high precision.
* **Key Innovation:** Uses **Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)** for signal purification and Hybrid DL models (DeepSupp, Time-LLM) combined with GenAI (FinBERT) for sentiment analysis.
* **Tech Stack:** PyTorch, Time-LLM, FinBERT, VMD, Python (Pandas/NumPy).

### **3. Fairness-Ensuring Legal AI Agent**
* **Concept:** A specialized Multi-Agent Framework designed to assist legal professionals while ensuring strict adherence to fairness and regulatory compliance.
* **Key Innovation:** Utilizes **PEFT-RAG (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning + Retrieval Augmented Generation)** to handle sensitive legal data accurately without hallucination.
* **Tech Stack:** LangChain, RAG, PEFT, Hugging Face Transformers, Multi-Agent Orchestration.

### **4. XAI Advertiser-Centric RTB (Real-Time Bidding)**
* **Concept:** Revolutionizing the AdTech industry by applying XAI to Real-Time Bidding. The system provides transparency to advertisers, explaining *why* their brand was chosen (or not) for specific ad inventory.
* **Key Innovation:** Solves the "black box" problem in programmatic advertising, enabling better auditing and trust.
* **Tech Stack:** Machine Learning (XGBoost/LightGBM), XAI (SHAP), Python.

## **Experience**

### **SDE Intern | Kognitive Networks** (Feb 2026 – Present)
* **RAG Knowledge Assistant:** Architected a production-grade RAG search bot on AWS (Bedrock + OpenSearch Serverless) to democratize internal knowledge access.
* **Network QoE Prediction:** Engineered an XGBoost-based forecasting system for TCP/RTP streams to predict Quality of Experience (QoE) in real-time.
* **AI Support Automation:** Built a scalable agent using **n8n** and **Pinecone** to automate customer support tickets.
* **Maritime Analytics:** Developed an AI-driven analytics engine on **Google ADK** for optimizing network usage in maritime environments.

---

## **Development Projects**

* **FocusWin:** A collaborative MERN stack productivity suite (Task management, Pomodoro, Team Chat).
* **CivicBot:** Serverless AWS-based civic complaint platform (Lambda, DynamoDB) with AI issue categorization.
* **OneStop.25:** Real-time GenAI user reflection and milestone analytics app (Firebase, Gemini API).
